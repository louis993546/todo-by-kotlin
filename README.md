# Todo By

Literally https://github.com/parker-codes/todo_by but for the Kotlin audience

### TODO (hah get it?)
- [ ] Go through the [kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html#how-ksp-looks-at-source-files)
- [ ] Define an annotation (probably `@TODOBy("2023-06-01")`)
- [ ] Figure out how to publish to maven easily these days
